	<!-- First we need to import the client library -->
	<script src="importio.js"></script>
	<script>
		// You may only use API key authentication with this library in a regular web browser. The
		// import.io platform's security policy prohibits you from issuing cookie-authenticated
		// requests cross-domain. However, we only recommend you use this library in browsers if it
		// is protected by some other form of security (such as it is an internal app or PoC only)
		// as your API key will be exposed to users of the website.

		// To initialise the client library with your API key, use the following code:
		var io = new importio("YOUR_USER_GUID", "YOUR_API_KEY");

		// Once we have started the client and authenticated, we need to connect it to the server:
		io.connect(function(connected) {
			// Make sure that your code to use the library only runs after this callback has returned, 
			// as prior to this the library is still connecting and may not yet be ready to issue queries

			// Once the callback is called, we need to check whether the connection request was successful
			if (!connected) {
				console.error("Unable to connect");
				return;
			}

			// Define here a variable that we can put all our results in to when they come back from
			// the server, so we can use the data later on in the script
			var data = [];

			// Record the number of currently running queries to the server
			var runningQueries = 0;

			// In order to receive the data from the queries we issue, we need to define a callback method
			// This method will receive each message that comes back from the queries, and we can take that
			// data and store it for use in our app
			var callback = function(finished, message) {
				// Disconnect messages happen if we disconnect the client library while a query is in progress
				if (message.type == "DISCONNECT") {
					console.error("The query was cancelled as the client was disconnected");
				}
				// Check the message we receive actually has some data in it
				if (message.type == "MESSAGE") {
					if (message.data.hasOwnProperty("errorType")) {
						// In this case, we received a message, but it was an error from the external service
						console.error("Got an error!", message.data);
					} else {
						// We got a message and it was not an error, so we can process the data
						console.log("Got data!", message.data);
						data = data.concat(message.data.results);
					}
				}
				if (finished) {
					// When the query is finished, show all the data that we received
					console.log("Done single query");
					runningQueries--;
					// If all queries are done, then log out the data we have
					if (runningQueries <= 0) {
						runningQueries = 0;
						console.log(data);
						console.log("All queries completed");
					}
				}
			}

			// Issue three queries to the same data source with different inputs
			// You can modify the inputs and connectorGuids so as to query your own sources
			// To find out more, visit the integrate page at http://import.io/data/integrate/#minijs
			
			// Also increment the number of queries we are running
			runningQueries += 3;

			io.query({"input":{ "query": "server" },"connectorGuids": [ "39df3fe4-c716-478b-9b80-bdbee43bfbde" ]}, callback);
			io.query({"input":{ "query": "ubuntu" },"connectorGuids": [ "39df3fe4-c716-478b-9b80-bdbee43bfbde" ]}, callback);
			io.query({"input":{ "query": "clocks" },"connectorGuids": [ "39df3fe4-c716-478b-9b80-bdbee43bfbde" ]}, callback);
